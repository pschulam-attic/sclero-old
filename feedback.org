*** DONE Plot patient curves with large norm.mse

*** DONE Plot mem and knn curves for low-scoring patients.

Plot some others as well.

*** TODO Run mem and knn experiments on DLCO

*** TODO Plot DLCO slope vs FVC slope

*** TODO Use antibody status for knn

E.g. restrict neighbors to same antibody.

*** TODO Investigate interpolation quality

For this we can try to look at some patients with high performance and
low performance and plot the interpolated curves of their nearest
neighbors against their own.
